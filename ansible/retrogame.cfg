# Sample configuration file for retrogame.
# Really minimal syntax, typically two elements per line w/space delimiter:
# 1) a key name (from keyTable.h; shortened from /usr/include/linux/input.h).
# 2) a GPIO pin number; when grounded, will simulate corresponding keypress.
# Uses Broadcom pin numbers for GPIO.
# NOTE: value 5 in second column correspond to GPIO 5, which is pin 29
# RPi 3 pinout: https://forum.pycom.io/topic/1519/power-up-wipy-from-raspberry-pi-3

# If first element is GND, the corresponding pin (or pins, multiple can be
# given) is a LOW-level output; an extra ground pin for connecting buttons.
# A '#' character indicates a comment to end-of-line.
# File can be edited "live," no need to restart retrogame!

SPACE      6  # 'Select' button
Q         26  # Exit ROM; PiTFT Button 1
9         19  # PiTFT Button 2
0         13  # PiTFT Button 3

# For configurations with few buttons (e.g. Cupcade), a key can be followed
# by multiple pin numbers.  When those pins are all held for a few seconds,
# this will generate the corresponding keypress (e.g. ESC to exit ROM).
# Only ONE such combo is supported within the file though; later entries
# will override earlier.
